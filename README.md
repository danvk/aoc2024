# Advent of Code 2016

## Day 1 (40886 / 37736)

Quite easy, interesting that the problem isn't entirely line-oriented. I can't imagine an LLM would have any trouble with the problem today.

After working through the first three days of the 2016 Advent of Code in Elixir, setup was no problem today. I can tell that pipes, the various `Enum` methods and `Map`s are going to be critical. I'm also wondering if this is going to be a strange introduction to Elixir. The AoC problems are all short-running, single-threaded, one-off scripts. My sense is that Elixir is better known as a language for long-running, concurrent processes.
